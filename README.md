This is my second attempt to build a fast sudoku solver.
In the beginning, I aimed to compete for the fastest solver.
However, I found too many problems which made me stop this project. 
It was named Ultra Sudoku Solver, but because it's unfinished, I instead leave it unnamed.
It's now called Alpxcx Sudoku Solver Prototype II. A trial to learn how sudoku solvers work.
My another project is more complete than this. It's called Simple Strategic Sudoku Solver.
(which could be named Alpxcx Sudoku Solver Prototype I)


It still solves all sudoku puzzles with only naked single and hidden single applied, and pretty fast.
usage:(use in console) sdmain.solve(string)
Examples:
"000105000140000670080002400063070010900000003010090520007200080026000035000409000"
